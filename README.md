# Corona Tracker
This repository is the source code for: http://corona-tracker.com

## About
This is a Flask+AngularJS webapp to track the locations that newly discovered COVID-19 patients have visited, so users can self-quarantine if they have come in contact with them.

The data is loaded from CSV files in *data/* at the moment due to time constraints. Will switch to a db later.
